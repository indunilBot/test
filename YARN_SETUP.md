# ✅ Yarn Setup Complete

## What Was Done:

1. ✅ **Removed npm artifacts**
   - Deleted `node_modules/`
   - Deleted `package-lock.json`

2. ✅ **Installed dependencies with Yarn**
   - Created `yarn.lock`
   - Installed all packages including Tailwind CSS v3.4.0

3. ✅ **Updated Wails configuration**
   - Changed `wails.json` to use Yarn commands:
     - `frontend:install`: `yarn install`
     - `frontend:build`: `yarn build`
     - `frontend:dev:watcher`: `yarn dev`

4. ✅ **Configured Tailwind CSS**
   - Created `tailwind.config.js`
   - Created `postcss.config.js`
   - Added Tailwind directives to `style.css`

## 🚀 Your App is Running with Yarn!

The application is now running at: **http://localhost:34115**

You can see in the terminal output:
```
Running frontend DevWatcher command: 'yarn dev'
```

## Commands to Use:

```bash
# Start development server
wails dev

# Build for production
wails build

# Frontend only (if needed)
cd frontend
yarn install    # Install dependencies
yarn dev        # Run dev server
yarn build      # Build for production
```

## ✨ What's Fixed:

1. ✅ **main redeclared** errors - Fixed by separating tools into subdirectories
2. ✅ **Blank page** - Fixed by installing Tailwind CSS
3. ✅ **npm usage** - Now using Yarn exclusively
4. ✅ **UI styling** - Tailwind CSS properly configured

## 📦 Installed Packages:

- React 18.2.0
